    1. Introduction to Cloud
    2. Create an AWS free tier account
    3. AWS Regions and Zones
    4. AWS Console Overview
    5. EC2 :
	Virtual Servers = Imaginary Server which is available in Cloud.
	On-demand Server (instantly we can create the servers)
    6. Key Pairs :
	Cloud Server having Keypairs.
	Extra Authentication
    7. Security Groups :
	Virtual firewall - it is a network security system which will allow and deny the traffic as per the firewall rules.
    8. AMI
    9. Free tier servers and paid servers
    10. Linux

    12. Linux User Management
    13. Linux File Permissions
    14. Linux File Editors
    15. Linux Basic/Advanced/Deployment Commands
    16. Linux Families (Debian and Redhat)
    17. AWS Storages
    18. EBS = BLock Level Storage, We can create 1gb to 16gb data Block by Block and we can attach it to EC2.
    19. S3 = Object Level Storage or Global Storage or Public Storage, We can store any type of files.
    20. EFS = File Level Storage
    21. Glacier = Mainly for backups and Archieve, fast glacier licence.
    22. Snapshots = backup copy or Replica.
    23. AWS Backup = dialy, weekly, monthly and on-demand
    24. CloudWatch = infrastructure monitoring tool
    25. CloudTrail = AWS console monitoring tool
    26. IAM
    27. MFA ('Multi Factor Authentication') = Extra Layer for Security
    28. VPC
    29. VPC Peering
    30. AutoScaling = Maintain and adjust resources for performance. Horizantal = increase EC2 and Vertical = increase compute resources.
    31. RDS ('Relational Database Service')
    32. AWS CLI ('Command Line Interface')
    33. ELB ('Elastic Load Balancer') = App Load balancer
    34. Elastic BeanStalk = We can create environement and deploy the applications
    35. AWS Lambda = service which will operate our infrastructure
    36. Route 53 = It will check the shortest path to access our servers.
    37. Cloud Formation = which will create Infrastructure Automation Service
    38. SNS ('Simple Notification Service')
    39. SQS ('Simple Queue Service')
    40. SES ('Simple Email Service')
    41. EKS ('Elastic Kubernetes Service')
