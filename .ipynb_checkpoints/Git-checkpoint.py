" What is Git " :
	* It is a Repository or Version Control tool.
	* Repository --> Where we can store our data.
	* Version Control --> Will track individaual data by using different version.
	* Git is used for source code management. It is free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
	* Git is used for tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together.

" What is a Repository " :
	* 'Repo' = Repository
	* Usually used to organize a single project.
	* repos can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets and data sets - anything your project needs.

" GIT " :
	* Created by Linus Torvalds, April 2005.
	* Replacement for BitKeeper to manage Linux Kernel changes.
	* A command line version control program.
	* uses checksums to ensure data integrity.
	* distributed version control (like BitKeeper).
	* Cross-platform support including windows.
